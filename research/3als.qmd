As a Research Assistant at the ALS Center of Excellence, University of Michigan, I've involved in a fascinating study of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). My project focuses on how peripheral immune profiles can predict the progression of ALS, measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score.

In collaboration with esteemed neurology experts, I applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering and LASSO-Cox regression models to the clinical dataset. These sophisticated statistical tools, often reserved for the realms of high-end data science, allowed us to unearth patterns that were not immediately apparent. My work wasn't just about numbers and models. It was about translating these complex findings into a format that could be easily understood by the broader medical community, including those without a statistical background. Using ggplot2, a tool in R for data visualization, I crafted aesthetically pleasing and informative visuals. The implications of this study are profound. By identifying key biomarkers, we've taken a significant step towards enhancing the precision of prognostic models for ALS.
