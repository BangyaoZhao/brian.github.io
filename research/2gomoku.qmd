In this project, I've implemented Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in a simplified version of the game Gomoku, coupled with an image-to-image prediction neural network to guide the tree-search. This venture into machine learning was inspired by my interest in Chinese Go and the great work of Google's AlphaGo in 2016.

Discover more about this project on my [Github](https://github.com/BangyaoZhao/gomoku), or experience the game through this online [link](https://bangyaozhao.github.io/gomoku.github.io/). I developed the game's GUI using Pygame, creating a lightweight HTML version that performs a limited number of simulations per move for a more accessible gaming experience.
