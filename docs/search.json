    "section": "",
    "text": "In the COVID-19 pandemic, as a researcher at the University of Michigan, I embarked on a project that stood at the intersection of public health urgency and statistical innovation. My work, titled “Bayesian Learning of COVID-19 Vaccine Safety,” was driven by a critical need: to bolster public confidence in the rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccines.\nWe focus on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a database with a large number of reports, but with noise and potential over-reporting issues. Recognizing the intricate relationships between different adverse events (AEs), I realized that existing statistical methods fell short in capturing this complexity. It was here that the idea for the Bayesian graph-assisted signal selection (BGrass) model took root.\nBGrass was a pioneering approach, the first of its kind to integrate AE ontology into vaccine-AE disproportionality analyses. The model wasn’t just another statistical tool; it was a novel lens through which the interconnected web of AEs could be viewed and understood. With BGrass, we could simultaneously evaluate the risk of all AEs while acknowledging their interdependencies under a logistic regression framework.\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects was mitigating reporting bias. To address this, I proposed a negative control approach, coupled with an enrichment method to pinpoint AE groups warranting attention. The computational backbone of BGrass was an efficient Gibbs sampler, utilizing Pólya-gamma data augmentation — a method I meticulously developed and made accessible through an R package.\nBut what did all this mean in practical terms? By applying BGrass to over a million VAERS reports, we weren’t just crunching numbers; we were identifying real signals amid the cacophony of data. We pinpointed eight AEs specifically related to COVID-19 vaccines, enhancing our understanding of post-vaccination safety. The accuracy of our estimations of log-odds ratios improved significantly — by up to 35% when abundant ontology information was available.\nThis journey with BGrass was more than a research project; it was a testament to the power of statistical ingenuity in addressing pressing public health challenges. As the world grappled with the uncertainties of a new disease and its vaccines, our work offered a beacon of clarity, contributing to the global effort to ensure vaccine safety and ultimately, to restore public trust in these life-saving tools."

    "text": "We have developed an advanced Bayesian model designed to enhance the P300 brain-computer interface (BCI) for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). [GitHub Link]\n \nThe two figures illustrate the P300 BCI design. In this setup, a participant focuses on a specific character within a \\(6\\times6\\) virtual keyboard. The keyboard’s rows and columns flash in a random sequence. The participant is tasked with mentally responding to the flash that occurs on their chosen character. Throughout this process, we collect EEG signals to monitor the participant’s responses to each flash. The algorithm is designed to discern which flashes cover the target character. By accurately determining the correct row and column, we can determine the target character at their intersection.\nOne of the primary innovations of our model lies in its capacity to condense EEG data from multiple electrodes into a single ``latent” channel. This technique effectively mitigates spatial correlations and diminishes noises from various electrode locations. Additionally, we’ve integrated a cutting-edge Gaussian process prior, which is for preserving time continuity within the model.\nOur team has developed a highly efficient, gradient-based variational inference algorithm, using TensorFlow Probability. We’ve released a user-friendly Python module on Github, designed to facilitate access and application of our model."

    "text": "As a Research Assistant at the ALS Center of Excellence, University of Michigan, I’ve involved in a fascinating study of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). My project focuses on how peripheral immune profiles can predict the progression of ALS, measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score.\nIn collaboration with esteemed neurology experts, I applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering and LASSO-Cox regression models to the clinical dataset. These sophisticated statistical tools, often reserved for the realms of high-end data science, allowed us to unearth patterns that were not immediately apparent. My work wasn’t just about numbers and models. It was about translating these complex findings into a format that could be easily understood by the broader medical community, including those without a statistical background. Using ggplot2, a tool in R for data visualization, I crafted aesthetically pleasing and informative visuals. The implications of this study are profound. By identifying key biomarkers, we’ve taken a significant step towards enhancing the precision of prognostic models for ALS."
