My academic journey revolves around a passion for developing computational-efficient Bayesian models that address real-world challenges. My doctoral dissertation is focused on non-invasive EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). When not doing research, I like playing an ancient Chinese board game 围棋 (Chinese GO)."
